# 🛣️ Analysis on Accidents in Indian Roads and Identification of Blackspots (Tamil Nadu)

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing road accident data in **Tamil Nadu** to identify critical **blackspots** — areas with a high concentration of road accidents. Using publicly available datasets, the study examines spatial, temporal, and categorical patterns to support better road safety planning and decision-making.

The data analysis and preprocessing were performed using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**, while **Power BI** was leveraged to create interactive dashboards for visual insights into accident severity, vehicle type involvement, and district-level trends. In addition, **QGIS** was utilized for geospatial mapping to pinpoint accident-prone regions and visualize high-risk zones across Tamil Nadu.

By integrating statistical analysis, visualization, and spatial intelligence, this project provides actionable insights into the underlying causes and distribution of accidents, helping inform policy interventions and infrastructure improvements for safer roads.
